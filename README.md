# Engineering_21_Game
What do I want my code to do? 

I want my code to create a game of 21 with players defined as a dealer and how ever many other players are playing. I want it to be able to tell when I win or lose while being able to swtch between players turns. I want to use a random number generator 1-12 to act as if I'm drawing cards in real life. I want to mastr the while loop with user inputs as well. Lastly, I want to define my own functions for my code and call every one I make.

What does my code currently do?

My code currently starts by defining a function which is my random number generator 1-12. It then asks for player's input on what is your name. It then repsonds back by saying hello (name). It then creates a variable with my function I created earlier, and it prints that function as a integer. Then, I created a while loop for when my random number is less than 21. Everytime it is, I ask whether the player wants to stay or go. If he goes, it will add on a random generated nuber 1-12 to the base number that was printed. It then keeps going until someone says stay instead of go, the number = 21 in which you win! will be said, or the number is over 21 in which it will say "You went over 21. You Lose!. It then stops the game with a break statement after that is done. 

What areas would I like guidance on?

I would like some guidance on player classes, and how I can make players in my game. I'm trying to be able to make a game where it determines the number of players, who of those players is the dealer, and a constant game where there isnt a break for everyone's turn. This is what I will need some guidance on how to do it.

Have you changed what you want your code to do?

I have not changed what I want my code to do. Its purpose has stayed the same throughout the whole project. I've always wanted to create a game of 21 with multiple turns by multiple people who use input to identify themselves. I've always wanted to be able to end the game as well on command.

What have you added to your code?

I have added a lot to my code since the last checkpoint. I now have lots of functions which are called and used in my code. I now have added a dealer and their turn to the code as well which is basically the same as the player's code, but it has different if statements involving and. I also have added input which helps me identify who the players are and if you want to play again.

What areas would I like guidance on?

I dont really have an area I would like guidance on at this moment. I'm kind of just seeing what I can do on my own by messing around with things.
