# Engineering_21_Game
What do I want my code to do? 

I want my code to create a game of 21 with players defined as a dealer and how ever many other players are playing. I want it to be able to tell when I win or lose while being able to swtch between players turns. I want to use a random number generator 1-12 to act as if I'm drawing cards in real life. I want to mastr the while loop with user inputs as well. Lastly, I want to define my own functions for my code and call every one I make.

What does my code currently do?

My code currently starts by defining a function which is my random number generator 1-12. It then asks for player's input on what is your name. It then repsonds back by saying hello (name). It then creates a variable with my function I created earlier, and it prints that function as a integer. Then, I created a while loop for when my random number is less than 21. Everytime it is, I ask whether the player wants to stay or go. If he goes, it will add on a random generated nuber 1-12 to the base number that was printed. It then keeps going until someone says stay instead of go, the number = 21 in which you win! will be said, or the number is over 21 in which it will say "You went over 21. You Lose!. It then stops the game with a break statement after that is done. 

What areas would I like guidance on?

I would like some guidance on player classes, and how I can make players in my game. I'm trying to be able to make a game where it determines the number of players, who of those players is the dealer, and a constant game where there isnt a break for everyone's turn. This is what I will need some guidance on how to do it.
